# Top 10 Films (No Particular Order)

These are 10 films that have stuck with me over the years. No ranking - just movies I love and think are worth your time. As of October 2025.

---

## Aliens (Director's Cut)
**Director:** James Cameron  
**Year:** 1986

Cameron took Ridley Scott's horror and turned it into an action masterpiece. The Director's Cut is a must with the extra scenes. Every sci-fi action game i've played, pays hommage to this piece of cinema. Every set piece is perfectly crafted, and the marines dialogue is endlessly quotable. This is how you do a sequel.

> *They're coming outta the walls. They're coming outta the goddamn walls.*

---

## The Godfather
**Director:** Francis Ford Coppola  
**Year:** 1972

What can you say that hasn't been said? Brando, Pacino, and one of the most perfectly constructed films ever made. The transformation of Michael Corleone remains one of cinema's greatest character arcs. Every frame and line is iconic.

> *Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.*

---

## Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
**Director:** George Roy Hill  
**Year:** 1969

The chemistry between Newman and Redford  is electric, mixing humor and heart with classic Western action. The final freeze-frame always gets me, pure cinema magic. A film that never ages.

> *Shouldn't take more than a couple of days. I'm not picky. As long as she's smart, pretty, and sweet, and gentle, and tender, and refined, and lovely, and carefree...*

---

## The Prestige
**Director:** Christopher Nolan  
**Year:** 2006

Nolan's most rewatchable film? Entertaing and thoughful mediation on  obsession, sacrifice, and the cost of greatness. Bale and Jackman are phenomenal, Johansson beautiful. 
> *The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything.*

---

## Rocky
**Director:** John G. Avildsen  
**Year:** 1976

Almost put in Rambo instead, but this classic is somehow raw, honest, and inspiring without being cheesy (unlike its follow-ups). I love how he knows he's going lose, but is doing it anyway - on his own terms. 

> *You're gonna eat lightnin' and you're gonna crap thunder!*

---

## Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
**Director:** Steven Spielberg  
**Year:** 1989

For me each one gets better, culminating with this one (P.S. I dont recognise the existence of 4 & 5). Adding Connery as Indy's dad was genius - their dynamic elevates everything. Adventure, humor, heart, and that final choice at the temple. Peak Spielberg delivering the complete action adventure family film.

> *Nazis. I hate these guys.*

---

## Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Director's Cut)
**Director:** James Cameron  
**Year:** 1991

Cameron in my list again, with another sequel.  The liquid metal T-1000 was groundbreaking at the times and still holds up kind off. I love the motorbike scene, and the Sarah Connor transformation - immense by Linda Hamilton.Try to watch the DC for more heart and  character development.  

> *I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle*

---

## Casino
**Director:** Martin Scorsese  
**Year:** 1995

Scorsese's most underrated masterpiece. And yes, I think its better then Goodfellas - a hill i'll happily die on. De Niro and Pesci at their brutal best, showing the rise and fall of Vegas with style and violence. The pen scene, the desert, Sharon Stone's performance.....utterly captivating. 

> *Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here: the right way, the wrong way, and the way that I do it. You understand?*

---

## Reservoir Dogs
**Director:** Quentin Tarantino  
**Year:** 1992

Tarantino's debut is argubly his best, stripped abck and not as indulgent as his otehrs. The dialogue, the soundtrack, that torture scene- all gripping. Film also announced many major acting talents too such was its calibur. 

> *you keep talking like a bitch, I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.*

---

## The Matrix
**Directors:** The Wachowskis  
**Year:** 1999

A film that redefined action cinema and influenced every subsequent video game in this genra- to the extent its (inferior) sequels felt more like a 'game' then a 'film'. The bullet-time, the philosophy, the style - and themes still relevent today. 

> *I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it*
