These are the songs that have soundtracked my life - the ones I never skip, the ones that hit different every time, and the ones I'll defend to anyone. No ranking, just ten songs I really like. Rule: Can't use the same artist twice. As of October 2025.

## Mr. Tambourine Man
**Artist:** Bob Dylan  
**Year:** 1965

This one's a big Dad influence - the song that became my gateway drug to Dylan. Interestingly, I came to it backwards, falling in love with various covers before I ever heard Dylan's own version. Once I did, I understood what all the fuss was about. There's something incredibly mesmerizing about how Dylan puts words together, weaving images and sounds into something that feels both ancient and immediate. What I love most is how many possible meanings have been attributed to this song over the decades. Personally, I like to think it's about chasing inspiration - that eternal pursuit of the creative spark. The definitive version for me is the live recording from the famous "Judas" tour at the Royal Albert Hall in London, 1966. That harmonica solo is  transcendent. If you know, you know.

## For Crying Out Loud
**Artist:** Meat Loaf  
**Year:** 1977

Another Dad influence - emotional, over-the-top maybe, but it goes over the top and then comes down the other side in the best possible way. What also hits hard is the wider context of how this album was made - the tumultuous up-and-down relationship between Jim Steinman and Meat Loaf adds another layer of meaning to these operatic emotional extremes. This is the album closer, bringing everything full circle with pure theatrical power.

## Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young
**Artist:** Fire Inc. (Jim Steinman)  
**Year:** 1984

Jim Steinman without Meat Loaf is an underappreciated gem. His two-song contribution to the *Streets of Fire* soundtrack is arguably peak Steinman for me - this song encompasses everything that's great about him as a musician. It's got the drama, the scope, the impossible romanticism, and that sense of desperate youth crying out against the dying of the light. Pure, undiluted Steinman magic that proves he was a visionary composer in his own right.

## Always
**Artist:** Bon Jovi  
**Year:** 1994

Probably the band that got me into music beyond pop songs. My dad had a VHS of their 1995 Live in London tour at Wembley Stadium - that tape is now worn down to the nub from repeated viewings. That performance of "Always" was simply epic, power ballad perfection captured on grainy video. Years later, I saw them live in Southampton in 2008, and when they saved "Always" for the encore, it was  bliss.

## Thunder Road
**Artist:** Bruce Springsteen  
**Year:** 1975

Dad's influence again with his love of 'The Boss' - I almost went with "No Surrender" but I went with my dad's fav; love the story told with this song and that last line! It's Springsteen at his most hopeful and romantic, painting a picture of escape and possibility. The way it builds from that gentle opening to the crescendo is an example of storytelling through music.

## Love Ire and Song
**Artist:** Frank Turner  
**Year:** 2008

Ah Frank, Frank, Frank. I initially missed the boat with him - had a mate at uni who told me all about him, but I didn't listen. After uni, I came across this during my radical politics phase and was completely blown away. I love all his stuff, especially his early years, which provided an apt soundtrack for my backpacking adventures. The honesty, the urgency, the acoustic punk ethos - it all clicked. Highly recommended live too, where his connection with the crowd is special.

## You Shook Me All Night Long
**Artist:** AC/DC  
**Year:** 1980

My favorite rock song. That riff, those lyrics - it's just emblematic of this particular genre. Everything that makes classic rock work is distilled into these three and a half minutes. Pure, unapologetic, fist-pumping rock and roll that never gets old. AC/DC at their absolute peak-lightning in a bottle.

## Don't Look Back in Anger
**Artist:** Oasis  
**Year:** 1995

The Gallagher brothers - can't not have a track by them in this list. This one narrowly beats out "Some Might Say" for me, mainly because I have so many happy memories of finishing nights out to this track. There's something about a crowd of people, arms around each other, singing this at the top of their lungs that just hits different. Oasis captured a nice mix with this - nostalgia, defiance, and hope. Nuff said.

## Pancho and Lefty
**Artist:** Townes Van Zandt  
**Year:** 1972

My favorite country track. This one pulls at the heart and reminds me of one of my favorite films. Townes Van Zandt was a master storyteller, and this tale of betrayal and regret is his masterpiece. The way he weaves the narrative, leaving just enough unsaid, is artistry. It's been covered by everyone from Willie and Merle to Emmylou Harris, but Townes' original has a rawness that can't be replicated.

## American Girl
**Artist:** Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  
**Year:** 1976

That guitar riff is just *chef's kiss*. Not sure what else to say - sometimes a song is just perfect as it is, and this is one of those times. Petty's ability to capture a whole American dream in three minutes is unmatched. This is the song you want playing when you're driving with the windows down. Magic.
