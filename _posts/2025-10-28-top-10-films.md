These are 10 films that have stuck with me over the years. No ranking - just movies I love and think are worth your time. As of October 2025.

## Aliens (Director's Cut)
**Director:** James Cameron  
**Year:** 1986

Cameron took Ridley Scott's horror and turned it into an action masterpiece. The Director's Cut is a must with the extra scenes. Every sci-fi action game I've played pays homage to this piece of cinema. Every set piece is perfectly crafted, and the marines' dialogue is endlessly quotable. This is how you do a sequel.

## The Godfather
**Director:** Francis Ford Coppola  
**Year:** 1972

What can you say that hasn't been said? Brando, Pacino, and one of the most perfectly constructed films ever made. The transformation of Michael Corleone remains one of cinema's greatest character arcs. Every frame and line is iconic.

## Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
**Director:** George Roy Hill  
**Year:** 1969

The chemistry between Newman and Redford is electric, mixing humor and heart with classic Western action. The final freeze-frame always gets me, pure cinema magic. A film that never ages.

## The Prestige
**Director:** Christopher Nolan  
**Year:** 2006

Nolan's most rewatchable film? Entertaining and thoughtful meditation on obsession, sacrifice, and the cost of greatness. Bale and Jackman are phenomenal, Johansson beautiful.

## Rocky
**Director:** John G. Avildsen  
**Year:** 1976

Almost put in Rambo instead, but this classic is somehow raw, honest, and inspiring without being cheesy (unlike its follow-ups). I love how he knows he's going to lose, but is doing it anyway - on his own terms.

## Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
**Director:** Steven Spielberg  
**Year:** 1989

For me each one gets better, culminating with this one (P.S. I don't recognize the existence of 4 & 5). Adding Connery as Indy's dad was genius - their dynamic elevates everything. Adventure, humor, heart, and that final choice at the temple. Peak Spielberg delivering the complete action adventure family film.

## Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Director's Cut)
**Director:** James Cameron  
**Year:** 1991

Cameron in my list again, with another sequel. The liquid metal T-1000 was groundbreaking at the time and still holds up kind of. I love the motorbike scene, and the Sarah Connor transformation - immense by Linda Hamilton. Try to watch the DC for more heart and character development.

## Casino
**Director:** Martin Scorsese  
**Year:** 1995

Scorsese's most underrated masterpiece. And yes, I think it's better than Goodfellas - a hill I'll happily die on. De Niro and Pesci at their brutal best, showing the rise and fall of Vegas with style and violence. The pen scene, the desert, Sharon Stone's performance... utterly captivating.

## Reservoir Dogs
**Director:** Quentin Tarantino  
**Year:** 1992

Tarantino's debut is arguably his best, stripped back and not as indulgent as his others. The dialogue, the soundtrack, that torture scene - all gripping. Film also announced many major acting talents too such was its caliber.

## The Matrix
**Directors:** The Wachowskis  
**Year:** 1999

A film that redefined action cinema and influenced every subsequent video game in this genre - to the extent its (inferior) sequels felt more like a 'game' than a 'film'. The bullet-time, the philosophy, the style - and themes still relevant today.
