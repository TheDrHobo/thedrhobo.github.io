These are the games that have stuck with me - the ones I return to, the ones that changed how I see gaming, and the ones I can't stop recommending. No ranking, just ten games worth your time. As of November 2025.

## The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/Zelda.jpg" alt="Ocarina of Time cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** Nintendo 64  
**Developer:** Nintendo  
**Year:** 1998

This is the game that defined what 3D adventure games could be. A technical achievement that was also a utterly captvating experiece. So many moments blew my mind as a kid.  The transition from child to adult Link, the dungeons that felt like elaborate puzzles, riding a horse, and the ocarina songs became part of gaming culture. Some call it the greatest game ever made, and honestly, I'm not going to argue. In fact, its top of my list.

> *Seeing the sunset over hyrule castle and having night fall....the realisation that this game had a dynamic day and night system had me in wonder; i also remember feeling immensly proud of myself when, at about 12 years old, I finished the final ganon fight*

## Half-Life
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/HL.jpg" alt="Half-Life cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** PC  
**Developer:** Valve  
**Year:** 1998

Half-Life changed everything about how we tell stories in first-person shooters. No cutscenes, no pulling control away from the player - just you, Gordon Freeman, living through a disaster in real-time. The opening tram ride through Black Mesa is still one of gaming's best introductions. Valve understood that environmental storytelling and emergent gameplay could be more powerful than any scripted sequence. The AI was genuinely threatening, with marines flanking you and working as squads. Every chapter felt different, from the claustrophobic tunnels to the alien world of Xen. Revolutionary doesn't even begin to cover it.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *"Forget about Freeman!" The moment when you realize the military isn't there to rescue you - they're there to silence everyone, including you. That shift from "we're saved" to "we're being hunted" was chilling. Also, finally getting outside after being trapped so long to navigate down that cliff also sticks out*

## GoldenEye 007
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/007.jpg" alt="GoldenEye 007 cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** Nintendo 64  
**Developer:** Rare  
**Year:** 1997

Simply iconic. Rare took a movie license - something usually synonymous with disaster - and created one of the N64's defining experiences. The campaign was brilliant, with multiple objectives depending on difficulty and levels that encouraged exploration and stealth. But the multiplayer? That's where friendships died. Four-player split-screen battles with proximity mines in the Facility, Slappers Only in the Complex, License to Kill mode making everyone a glass cannon - these became the stuff of legend. Oddjob was banned in my house for being too short. It's the game that made local multiplayer FPS a phenomenon on consoles.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *The first time I saw a guard on the opening level actually react to where you shot them as a 10 year is forever etched into my mind. I could not beleive that realism could exist in a video game  -a few years later, when i was allowed to actually play the game, iu sed to love the 2nd level 'Facility', sneaking through the ventilation system above the bathroom stalls, dropping down behind an unsuspecting guard...*

## The Last of Us
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/last.webp" alt="The Last of Us cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** PlayStation 3  
**Developer:** Naughty Dog  
**Year:** 2013

The Last of Us hit differently. Naughty Dog created something that transcended the zombie apocalypse genre - this was a story about broken people trying to find meaning in a dead world. Joel and Ellie's journey across a ruined America was emotionally devastating in ways few games achieve. But what really struck me was the weight of the gameplay. That first brutal stealth kill - grabbing someone from behind and violently smashing their head into the environment - made me realize this wasn't your typical third-person action game. There was real heft to the violence, a desperation that matched the narrative. The way you interacted with the environment, scavenging for supplies, crafting makeshift weapons - everything reinforced the sense of survival. And then there's the giraffe moment in Salt Lake City, watching these majestic creatures wandering through an overgrown urban landscape, nature reclaiming the world humanity destroyed. Pure beauty amidst the horror. The ending remains one of gaming's most morally complex and unforgettable moments.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *Two moments define this game for me: First, that initial stealth kill where you grab someone and brutally smash their head into the scenery - the visceral impact, the sound design, the weight of it made me go "wow, this is serious." Second, the giraffes in Salt Lake City. After hours of violence and darkness, just standing there watching them peacefully graze among the ruins, nature reclaiming the cities - it was breathtaking. A moment of pure tranquility that made everything feel worth it.*

## Final Fantasy IV
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/ff4.jpeg" alt="Final Fantasy IV cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** Super Nintendo  
**Developer:** Square  
**Year:** 1991

Final Fantasy IV is really the first JRPG that knew waht is was doing. It realised that for a JRPG to be successful, a robust battle system in a cool setting wasn't enougth, the crucial ingrediant is story. And FF4 told one with real emotional weight - betrayal, redemption, sacrifice. Indeed, Cecil's journey from Dark Knight to Paladin wasn't just a gameplay gimmick; it was character development that meant something. The cast rotated in and out, which was devastating when characters you'd grown attached to left. Tellah's revenge, Palom and Porom's sacrifice (made me cry), the trip to the moon - Square was swinging for the fences narratively. Not to mention Nobuo Uematsu's stunning soundtrack.

> *It has to be Palom and Porom's sacrifice - still not got over it 20 years later*

## FTL: Faster Than Light
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/ftl.jpg" alt="FTL cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** PC  
**Developer:** Subset Games  
**Year:** 2012

FTL is brutal, unforgiving, and absolutely brilliant. It's a roguelike space strategy game that creates emergent stories through its systems. Every run is different, every decision matters, and you will fail - repeatedly. But those failures create the best stories. Your Mantis boarding party gets stuck on an enemy ship as it explodes. Your weapons malfunction during a crucial battle. A solar flare kills half your crew. The game's genius is in how it makes you care about your randomly generated crew members within minutes, then rips them away. The pause-and-plan combat is tense, the ship customization is deep, and the soundtrack is hauntingly perfect. It's "just one more run" incarnate.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *Finally reaching the final boss flagship after dozens of failed runs, with a ship barely holding together and a skeleton crew. Every system is damaged, you're out of missiles, and your shield is down to one layer. But somehow, through desperate micro-management and sheer luck, you win. The relief is overwhelming*

## Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/kotor.jpg" alt="Knights of the Old Republic cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** Xbox  
**Developer:** BioWare  
**Year:** 2003

BioWare took Star Wars to a place the movies never could - 4,000 years before the films, where they had freedom to tell their own story. And what a story. KOTOR delivered one of gaming's best plot twists, created memorable companions (HK-47's homicidal commentary alone is worth the price), and let you genuinely role-play as Jedi or Sith. The morality system had weight, the lightsaber combat felt powerful despite the D&D-style mechanics underneath, and exploring the Star Wars universe without movie constraints was liberating. Taris, Dantooine, Tatooine, Kashyyyk - each planet felt distinct and alive. It's the best Star Wars story outside the original trilogy, and I'll die on that hill.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *The reveal on the Leviathan - that moment when everything clicks into place and you realize what you are. The game had been dropping hints throughout, but actually experiencing that twist was staggering. It recontextualized the entire journey and made you question every choice you'd made. Brilliant narrative design that only works in an interactive medium.*

## Grim Fandango
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/grim.png" alt="Grim Fandango cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** PC  
**Developer:** LucasArts  
**Year:** 1998

Tim Schafer's masterpiece - a film noir detective story set in the Land of the Dead with Mexican Day of the Dead aesthetics and Art Deco design. It shouldn't work, but it's one of gaming's most original and memorable experiences. Manny Calavera's four-year journey through the underworld is genuinely gripping, filled with conspiracy, romance, and betrayal. The writing is razor-sharp, the characters unforgettable, and the world-building is immaculate. Whilst the puzzles were sometimes obtuse the atmosphere, story, and sheer creativity made it essential. It was criminally underappreciated at launch, but history has rightfully recognized it as one of the greatest adventure games ever made.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *The seconed chapter really stands out in my mind to this day - the syle and maturity of themes, the swelling jazz music, and how the narrative threads develooped and came together. The first game that me realise that 'video games' were an art form on the level of film and books.*

## Super Smash Bros. Melee
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/melee.jpg" alt="Super Smash Bros Melee cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** GameCube  
**Developer:** HAL Laboratory  
**Year:** 2001

Melee was lightning in a bottle - a party game that accidentally became one of the most technical fighting games ever made. Nintendo's all-stars brawling on increasingly chaotic stages was fun enough, but the advanced techniques (wavedashing, L-canceling, directional influence) created a skill ceiling so high that people are still mastering it twenty years later. The roster was perfect, the stages were memorable, and the speed was just right - faster and tighter than the original, with more weight than later entries. It dominated competitive gaming for decades and still has a passionate scene. Four-player free-for-alls with items on high were chaos. One-on-one Fox dittos on Final Destination were intense technical showcases. Melee accommodated both and excelled at everything.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *Landing a fully charged Falcon Punch in a heated four-player match - the slow wind-up, the desperate hope that it connects, the explosive "YES!" when it sends someone flying off the screen. Or unlocking Mewtwo after hours of gameplay and discovering this floaty, weird, powerful character. Every unlock felt like Christmas morning.*

## Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/videogames/red.webp" alt="Red Alert 2 cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Platform:** PC  
**Developer:** Westwood Studios  
**Year:** 2000

Red Alert 2 is the most fun I've ever had with an RTS. Westwood fully embraced the camp - Soviet invasion of America with psychic commanders, Tesla coils, and Kirov airships - and created something gloriously absurd yet mechanically solid. The two campaigns were both ridiculous and engaging, with live-action cutscenes that knew exactly how silly they were. The Yuri's Revenge expansion made it even better. It was accessible enough for casual players but deep enough for competitive play. Peak RTS design wrapped in Cold War absurdity.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Favorite Moment</strong></summary>

> *The Soviet campaign mission where you use mind-controlled squids to ruin the allied forces navy. It perfectly encapsulated Red Alert's joyous absurdity - historically themed strategy married to complete B-movie madness. The opening cut scene too, with Soviet's premier gleeful "why Mr President, whatever do you mean...?" followed by that pumping soundtrack*
