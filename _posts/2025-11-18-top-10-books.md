These are the books that have stuck with me - the ones I return to, the ones that changed how I see stories, and the ones I can't stop recommending. No ranking, just ten books worth your time. As of October 2025.

## Tortilla Flat
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/Tortilla2.jpeg" alt="Tortilla Flat book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** John Steinbeck  
**Year:** 1935

Steinbeck is often associated with heavy school reading lists and *Of Mice and Men*, but my favorite of his is the hilarious and heartwarming *Tortilla Flat* - probably my most re-read book. It follows a group of paisanos in post-WWI Monterey, California, living life on their own terms with wine, friendship, and questionable adventures. The prose is beautiful and deceptively simple. I think it's much better than its spiritual cousin *Cannery Row*. These are lovable characters I'd genuinely love to have a drink with - flawed, funny, and utterly authentic. It's Steinbeck at his most joyful.

<blockquote style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5em;">Two gallons is a great deal of wine, even for two paisanos. Spiritually the jugs maybe graduated thus: Just below the shoulder of the first bottle, serious and concentrated conversation. Two inches farther down, sweetly sad memory. Three inches more, thoughts of old and satisfactory loves. An inch, thoughts of bitter loves. Bottom of the first jug, general and undirected sadness. Shoulder of the second jug, black, unholy despondency. Two fingers down, a song of death or longing. A thumb, every other song each one knows. The graduations stop here, for the trail splits and there is no certainty. From this point anything can happen.</blockquote>

## This Thing of Darkness
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/thing.jpg" alt="This Thing of Darkness book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Harry Thompson  
**Year:** 2005

This book absolutely blew my mind. Almost every chapter made me stop and think - really think - about history, morality, and the cost of progress. Learning about Captain Robert FitzRoy, one of the most underestimated and under-recognized figures from Victorian England, was a revelation. He's been completely overshadowed by his more famous passenger, Charles Darwin, and that injustice upsets me every time I think about it. Thompson brings FitzRoy to life with such humanity and detail that you feel his struggles, his brilliance, and his tragedy. RIP Captain FitzRoy - you deserved better from history.

## The Blade Itself
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/blade.jpg" alt="The Blade Itself book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Joe Abercrombie  
**Year:** 2006

Just wow. This book introduced me to grimdark fantasy and I've never looked back. Abercrombie tears down every fantasy trope you think you know and rebuilds them with brutal honesty and dark humor. But the real star is Glokta - my favorite character in all of fantasy. A tortured former war hero turned torturer, he's  darkly funny, and utterly compelling. The book is epic and haunting in equal measure - once you start, you can't put it down. Imagine if Gandalf was a complete asshole and the Fellowship was full of morally compromised antiheroes. If that sounds appealing, this trilogy is for you.

## A Storm of Swords
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/Storm.jpg" alt="A Storm of Swords book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** George R.R. Martin  
**Year:** 2000

The Red Wedding. Need I say more? This is the book where Martin proved he was willing to break every rule and our hearts along with them. The foreshadowing leading up to that moment was masterful - you knew logically that something was wrong, the signs were all there, but your heart refused to let you believe it. Turning those pages was emotionally painful in a way few books achieve. I've never had a reading experience quite like it. If you read it before watching the show, it hits even harder - something really special and unforgettable. Martin at his absolute peak. P.S. George, seriously - how much longer until *The Winds of Winter*?

## Wool
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/wool.jpg" alt="Wool book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Hugh Howey  
**Year:** 2011

This one came out of nowhere and completely blindsided me. Howey's vision of humanity living in underground silos is fresh and compelling - the mystery unfolds in a way that hooks you from the first chapter. It's a masterclass in world-building that reveals itself slowly. A page-turner that proves self-published books can compete with the big publishers. The TV adaptation is decent but certainly not a replacement - indeed, it never does justice to the slow build up of tension and claustophobic atmosphere.

## River God
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/river.jpg" alt="River God book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Wilbur Smith  
**Year:** 1993

Growing up, I devoured Wilbur Smith's adventure novels - they were my gateway to historical fiction and page-turners. Picking just one was incredibly difficult, Birds of Prey and 'Shout at the Devil' come close, but *River God* edges it for me. Set in ancient Egypt during the Hyksos invasion, it's Smith at his best - sweeping historical drama mixed with adventure, romance, and intrigue. The story is told through the eyes of Taita, a eunuch slave who's cleverer than everyone else in the room, and his devotion to his mistress Lostris drives the entire epic. Smith's Egypt feels vivid and alive, and the scope spans decades. It's the first in his Egyptian series, and probably the only one you need to read.

## Children of Time
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/children.jpg" alt="Children of Time book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Adrian Tchaikovsky  
**Year:** 2015

I picked this up when I really needed a sci-fi hit, it delivered and then some. Tchaikovsky takes a concept that shouldn't work - uplifted spiders as the main characters - and makes it utterly compelling. The scope is epic, spanning generations and civilizations, while never losing sight of what makes great sci-fi: exploring what it means to be sentient, to build a society, to survive. The dual timeline structure keeps the tension high, and the payoff is worth every page. This is an example of perfect sci-fi for me - big ideas executed brilliantly with genuine heart.

## Midshipman's Hope
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/Midship.jpg" alt="Midshipman's Hope book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** David Feintuch  
**Year:** 1994

I can't quite explain why I love this series so much, but I keep coming back to it. It's a great coming-of-age story set in space - essentially the sci-fi equivalent of *Master and Commander*, with a young officer thrust into impossible situations and forced to grow up fast. Nicholas Seafort is flawed, sometimes frustratingly so, but that's what makes his journey compelling. The first and fourth books in the series are particular standouts. Another serious contender for my most re-read novel - there's something about Feintuch's spare, direct prose and moral complexity that keeps pulling me back.

## Lonesome Dove
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/dove.jpg" alt="Lonesome Dove book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Larry McMurtry  
**Year:** 1985

This book holds a special place in my heart - it connects me to my dad, who has now sadly passed away. It was one of his favorites, and I only read it recently, finally understanding why. Now I can say it's one of mine too. It's an epic Western yarn that spans thousands of miles and feels like you're living every dusty mile alongside the characters. McMurtry's prose is deceptively simple but devastating when it needs to be. Gus and Call are two of the best-drawn characters in American literature. The miniseries adaptation is excellent and does the book justice, but reading it first is the way to go. Simply unmissable - a masterpiece that earns every one of its 800+ pages.

## Taming Poison Dragons
<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/books/Dragon.jpg" alt="Taming Poison Dragons book cover" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; max-width: 200px;">

**Author:** Tim Murgatroyd  
**Year:** 2009

This book transported me completely. Murgatroyd's medieval China isn't just window dressing - you step into it with all your senses. The sights, sounds, smells, and politics of Tang Dynasty China feel lived-in and real. The protagonist is compelling and flawed, navigating court intrigue and personal tragedy with a authenticity that makes the historical setting feel immediate rather than distant. It's literary historical fiction that never forgets to tell a gripping story. Criminally underrated and deserves far more recognition.
